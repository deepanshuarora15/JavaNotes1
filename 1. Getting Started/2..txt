1. Every Java program should have atleast one function known as main() or psvm(String[] args)
2. A class is a container for one or more related functions.
3. Eg: in supermarket you have sections. Each section contains related products. Eg: fruits
4. Everything in Java needs to be inside the classes. So function is not the right terminology. The right word is methods.
5. Access modifiers like public, private, protected etc.
6. Naming convention:
   a. Classes are named in Pascal notation. Eg: Main
   b. Methods are camelcase. Eg: getDetails()
