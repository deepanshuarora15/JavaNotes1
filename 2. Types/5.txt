1. In primitve data types:
    int a = 5;
    int b = a;
    a = 10;
    sout(a,b) // 10 5
    * In primitive datatypes, a new variable is generated , with different memory allocation. Copy by value

2. This is not the case in referential data types. 
   Eg Point p1 = new Point(x:10, y:20);
      Point p2;
      p2 = p1;
      p1.x = -20
      sout(p2.x) // -20
   Note: problem here is that these are referential data types. Changes in one are gonna affect the other. Copy by reference
