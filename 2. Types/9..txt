1. int [][] numbers = new int[2][3];
   numbers[0][0] = 1;
   
   sout(numbers) // does not work

2. sout(Arrays.toString(numbers)) // also does not work

3. Imp: This is because we are dealing with multi-dimension array

 Solution:
  sout(Arrays.deepToString(numbers))
  1 0 0
  0 0 0

4. Another syntax is:
   int [][] numbers = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};
   // 1 2 3 
   // 4 5 6
