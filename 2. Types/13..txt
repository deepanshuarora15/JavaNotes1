1. Implicit casting is what Java does.
2. (int)x // this is explicit casting, done by us.
3. String str = "1";
   (int)str // this won't work and throw an error because of obvious reasons
 
Solution:
 int x = Integer.parseInt(str);
 
4. Where to use: In most frameworks, the default nature of input from user is Strings. Hence the above code helps

5. Imp: Remember if the user enters a double, then you are gonna be in trouble
   The above code is gonna give errors

Solution:

double x = Double.parseDouble(str);
