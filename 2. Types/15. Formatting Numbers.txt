1. We have a class called NumberFormat defined in java.text

   import java.util.text.NumberFormat;

   NumberFormat n = new NumberFormat(); // error. Because this class is abstract class and it's object cannot be instantiated.

2.  NumberFormat n = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() 
    // This is a factory method that is a hack for instantiating objects of abstract classes
3. String result = n.format(1234567.891); // $1234,567.89

4. For replacing / refactoring, right click on variable name and refactor. This way it would get changed everywhere in the current class

5.  NumberFormat n = NumberFormat.getPercentInstance() 
    String result = percent.format(0.1); // prints 10%
