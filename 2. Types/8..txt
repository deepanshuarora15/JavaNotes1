1. Arrays are referential data type, hence new keyword is used.
2. int[] number = new int[5];
   number[0]=1;
   number[1]=2;
   .... and so on
3. sout(number); //prints gibberish. 
4. To print it better use Arrays class
   import java.util.Arrays;

   sout(Arrays.toString(number)); // toString method is overloaded and can accept arrays of all primitive data types.
5. By default an integer array contains all zeroes. A string array contains all empty strings.
6. The above is an old manner of initialization. A newer method is below. New keyword is not required
	int[] number = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } ;
7. If you want to sort, use the Arrays class again, as it has an in-built sort method:
   sout(Arrays.sort(number)) // 1,2,3,4,5
